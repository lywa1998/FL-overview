	abstract = 	 {Most commonly used distributed machine learning systems are either synchronous or centralized asynchronous. Synchronous algorithms like AllReduce-SGD perform poorly in a heterogeneous environment, while asynchronous algorithms using a parameter server suffer from 1) communication bottleneck at parameter servers when workers are many, and 2) significantly worse convergence when the traffic to parameter server is congested. Can we design an algorithm that is robust in a heterogeneous environment, while being communication efficient and maintaining the best-possible convergence rate? In this paper, we propose an asynchronous decentralized stochastic gradient decent algorithm (AD-PSGD) satisfying all above expectations. Our theoretical analysis shows AD-PSGD converges at the optimal $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate as SGD and has linear speedup w.r.t. number of workers. Empirically, AD-PSGD outperforms the best of decentralized parallel SGD (D-PSGD), asynchronous parallel SGD (A-PSGD), and standard data parallel SGD (AllReduce-SGD), often by orders of magnitude in a heterogeneous environment. When training ResNet-50 on ImageNet with up to 128 GPUs, AD-PSGD converges (w.r.t epochs) similarly to the AllReduce-SGD, but each epoch can be up to 4-8x faster than its synchronous counterparts in a network-sharing HPC environment. To the best of our knowledge, AD-PSGD is the first asynchronous algorithm that achieves a similar epoch-wise convergence rate as AllReduce-SGD, at an over 100-GPU scale.}

	abstract = 	 { Traditional federated learning algorithms impose strict requirements on the participation rates of devices, which limit the potential reach of federated learning. This paper extends the current learning paradigm to include devices that may become inactive, compute incomplete updates, and depart or arrive in the middle of training. We derive analytical results to illustrate how allowing more flexible device participation can affect the learning convergence when data is not independently and identically distributed (non-IID). We then propose a new federated aggregation scheme that converges even when devices may be inactive or return incomplete updates. We also study how the learning process can adapt to early departures or late arrivals, and analyze their impacts on the convergence. }

In this work, we present an analysis hinting that high similarity between concurrently processed gradients may be a cause of this performance degradation. We introduce the notion of gradient diversity that measures the dissimilarity between concurrent gradient updates, and show its key role in the convergence and generalization performance of mini-batch SGD.  We also establish that heuristics similar to DropConnect, Langevin dynamics, and quantization, are provably diversity-inducing mechanisms, and provide experimental evidence indicating that these mechanisms can indeed enable the use of larger batches without sacrificing accuracy and lead to faster training in distributed learning. For example, in one of our experiments, for a convolutional neural network to reach 95% training accuracy on MNIST, using the diversity-inducing mechanism can reduce the training time by 30% in the distributed setting.}
